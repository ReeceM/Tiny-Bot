Tiny-Bot
========

ATTiny light influenced robot source code and board design files

This is the repository for the Tiny Bot that I designed after being influenced by the design of born 2 craft light bot.

Code
========
The code is written in the Arduino IDE as it was the quickest way to change and flash code when building(to me).
I plan to change it over to to correct C++ in months to come to shrink code size.

Design

The design can be found at http://ziggyelectronics.blogspot.com/2014/12/tiny-bot.html
